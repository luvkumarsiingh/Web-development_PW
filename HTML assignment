4)In HTML, a tag is a piece of code that specifies the beginning or end of an element. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< >) and usually come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. 
The opening tag contains the element name, and the closing tag contains the same element name but is preceded by a forward slash (/).
example: <p> is a opening tag.

Elements invloves both closing and opening tag .
example:<p>my code is improving</p>

The DOCTYPE declaration in HTML is a special instruction that appears at the very top of an HTML document. 
It tells the web browser what version of HTML the document is written in, so the browser can render the content correctly.
